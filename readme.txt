Usage: - Open a movie in VLC - (optional) Stop the movie - Open the the VLC menu: “View->Subtitles Finder” (this activates the plugin) - Open the the plugin menu: “View->Subtitles Finder->Download”Notes:  - Because of internal changes in VLC, the minimum version of VLC required is 1.1.0  - VLC support only uncompressed .rar files  - VLC 1.1.x do not support lua scripts that uses GUIs under MAC-OSx, so:    this plugin WILL NOT work on your MAC!Know issues:  - The search fail if you click the button two times consecutivelyRecent fixes:  - Now works on Linux-VLC.  The fix should not break Windows VLC, but is untested.    .Abraham van Helpsing
